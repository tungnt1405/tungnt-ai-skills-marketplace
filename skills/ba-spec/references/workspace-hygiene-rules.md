# Workspace Hygiene Rules

Use these rules whenever the agent creates helper scripts, temporary extraction files, generated intermediates, or HTML conversion helpers.

## Core rule

Temporary helper artifacts must not be left in the user's project root.

Bad examples:

```text
extract_texts.py
generate_html.py
output.txt
extracted_texts.txt
figma_raw.json
markdown_cache.json
```

## Where temporary files may be created

Use one of these locations only:

1. OS temp directory with a `ba-spec-` prefix.
2. Package-local temporary directory:

```text
{{package-folder}}/.tmp/
```

Do not create helper scripts in the current working directory unless that directory is the package `.tmp/` directory.

## Cleanup requirement

Before final response:

1. Move final deliverables into the package directory.
2. Delete package `.tmp/`.
3. Delete any accidental root helper files created during the run.
4. Do not delete user-provided input files.
5. Do not delete files that existed before the run unless the user explicitly asked.

## Package-local generated files

By default, only these may remain because they are final deliverables:

```text
feature-spec.md
feature-spec.html
```

Extra package-local files such as package readmes, Figma link indexes, evidence logs, handoff checklists, or question lists may remain only if the user explicitly requested separated companion files.

If the user did not ask for companion files, embed that information into `feature-spec.md` and `feature-spec.html` instead of creating extra files.

## Dependency rule

Do not run package installs such as `pip install markdown`, `npm install`, or similar in the user's project without explicit need and without explaining it. Prefer:

- existing skill templates,
- built-in language/runtime libraries,
- temporary script in `.tmp/`,
- no dependency install.

If a dependency install is unavoidable, ask the user or clearly state why it is needed.

## Final cleanup statement

The final response must include a cleanup statement in the output language, for example:

```text
Đã dọn file tạm: không còn helper script như extract_texts.py/generate_html.py ở thư mục gốc.
```
